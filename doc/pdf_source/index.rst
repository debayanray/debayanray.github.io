Career Profile
##############

I'm a Software Developer, most of the time I work on software applications backend, mostly with
**Python** (these days on Django and DRF frameworks).

I have **18 years of experience** in designing and implementing complex and
distributed software systems. Also I have a decent knowledge in Linux based development and have
prior work experience with k8s and Docker.

Long time back I had also worked on frontend, most of the time with **BackboneJS**.

I have also spent a significant amount of time contributing to **opensource software** development
(predominantly **Openstack**). Played the role of an active developer and **core reviewer** in
subprojects, like `Sushy`_ and `Proliantutils`_, of `OpenStack Ironic`_ 
(*Baremetal server provisioning*) project.

Moreover I started my career with **C++** and had spent my initial days of my career (around 6 years)
with it.

**In brief**, I am an Opensource enthusiast and *I like building cool stuff!*
