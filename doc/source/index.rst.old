##############
Career Profile
##############

I'm a Software Developer, most of the time I work on software applications
backend, mostly with **Python** and **Java**.

I have **15 years of experience** in designing and implementing complex and
distributed software systems. Also I have a basic knowledge in Linux
administration/DevOps and work with Kubernetes/Docker.

Sometime back I had also worked on frontend, most of the time with
**BackboneJS**.

I have also spent a significant amount of time contributing to **opensource
software** development (predominantly **Openstack**). Played the role of an
active developer and **core reviewer** in subprojects, like `Sushy`_ and
`Proliantutils`_, of `OpenStack Ironic`_ (*Baremetal server provisioning*)
project.

Moreover I started my career with **C++** and had spent my initial days of my
career (around 6 years) with it.

I also have a bit of experience in mobile development with Android.

In brief, I am an Opensource enthusiast and *I like building cool stuff!*
