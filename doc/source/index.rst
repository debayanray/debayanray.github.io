Career Profile
##############

I'm a Software Developer, most of the time I work on software applications
backend, mostly with **Python** and **Java**.

I have **15 years of experience** in designing and implementing complex and
distributed software systems. Also I have a basic knowledge in Linux
administration/DevOps and work with Kubernetes/Docker and gitlab-ci.

Sometime back I had also worked on frontend, most of the time with
*BackboneJS*.

I have also spent a significant amount of time contributing to **opensource
software** development (predominantly **Openstack**). Played the role of an
active developer and **core reviewer** in subprojects, like `Sushy`_ and
`Proliantutils`_, of `OpenStack Ironic`_ (*Baremetal server provisioning*)
project.

Moreover I started my career with *C++* and had been with it for the initial
6 years of my career.
